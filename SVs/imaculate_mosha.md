title: Being a student volunteer at ICFP 2016
author: Imaculate Mosha

I’m Imaculate Mosha, a final year Undergraduate student at the
University of Cape Town. I study Electrical and Computer Engineering
and I’m working on Machine Learning for my final year thesis. My
interest in functional languages grew from Dyalog APL, Scheme and
Haskell. I was a student volunteer at ICFP 2016.

Most of the talks were great, some were over my head, one really stood
out for me. It was [‘How to write papers so people can read
them’](http://conf.researchr.org/event/icfp-2016/plmw-icfp-2016-how-to-write-papers-so-people-can-read-them)
by Derek Dreyer -- see the
[slides](https://www.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/talks/talk-plmw16.pdf) or
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM1Atui30qU&list=PLnqUlCo055hWgpvok3qqLpIy3ow3Z-88s&index=8). I was
drawn to it because I have just started writing my thesis, my very
first research publication. The main point of the talk was that there
is a gap between the author and readers. To bridge this gap, the paper
must have flow, coherence, new terminologies must be named and
relevant concepts be introduced just in time, not earlier. He also
gave a paper structure that works best. Later than evening, I ended up
rewriting my entire thesis!
