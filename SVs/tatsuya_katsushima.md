Hi, My name is Tatsuya Katsushima, Graduate School of Information
Sciences at Tohoku University, Japan. My research topic is embedding
SQL by tagless-final style under Oleg Kiselyov
guidance. I participated to ICFP 2016 as a student volunteer.

One of the most interesting talks for me was Takayuki Muranushi's
research in FHPC workshop -- [short
article](https://github.com/nushio3/formura/blob/master/reference/muranushi%2B-fhpc2016.pdf)
and
[slides](https://github.com/nushio3/formura/blob/master/reference/slides-fhpc2016.pdf). He
talked about
[Formura](https://github.com/nushio3/formura/blob/master/reference/slides-fhpc2016.pdf)
which is a language for simplifying HPC programming. Users can
describe mathematical concepts as operation over derivative operators
in Formura and this code is transformed to optimized C code.

I have been studying embedded DSLs, so I learned a lot from his
language design and implementation method. Unfotunately, due to my
lack of preliminary knowledge about HPC, I couldn't fully appreciate
the Formura's problem domain. But I felt this research is very
interesting so I am thinking of learning more about HPC.
