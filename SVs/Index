title: ICFP 2016 Student Volunteers reports

Many people need to work together to organize a several-hundred-people
conference. There is a lot of scientific work involved, defining the
events that will take place, accepting talks to them, etc. There is
also a lot of non-scientific work involved, before and during the
conference itself. During the conference, a portion of that work is
done by student volunteers, that pour around a dozen hours of work
each, in exchange for free registration. I personally think it's
a great way, as a student, to travel at lower cost, meet new people,
and see the organization side of an academic conference.

If you came to [ICFP 2016](http://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2016),
you surely interacted with student volunteers, when coming at the
registration desk, or to get your lunch box, attend the banquet or the
receptions, to get the microphone to ask a question. Some of the [ICFP
videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRL68qZFfub1Ep1EScfmBw/playlists)
available online were also recorded by student volunteers.

This year we asked student volunteers to write a blog post to say
a few words about their conference experience. This is what this
section is for. See the [list of student posts](/SVs), and feel free
to subscribe to the [syndication feed](../atom), which also contains
summaries of the conference talks.
