title: The talk was very educational and interesting

I am Ryo Sakuma and I am a graduate student at Tohoku University.

My current supervisor is Eijiro Sumii.
I participated in ICFP2016 as a student volunteer.

I am studying about verification methods for concurrent data
structure. In particular, concurrent separation logic.

I thought the most interesting talk at the conference was
"Hierarchical Memory Management for Parallel Programs" by Ram
Raghunathan et al. This talk presented a hierarchical memory manager
for parallel functional programs and a parallel garbage collector.

I am mainly studying verification for low-level languages that do not
have a garbage collector. The talk was very educational and
interesting because I do not know a lot about garbage collectors and
also I did not know the term "hierarchical" memory management.

Unfortunately, I was not able to understand the whole talk because
I do not have enough English ability and technical knowledge. This
experience motivated me to study more English and this field of study.

It was a very motivating experience to listen directly to top-level
researchers having lively discussions. I hope to one day be able to
participate in these kind of discussions.
